cards can have 1 or many editions

Cards don't have prices only editions do. 
Cards don't have URLs only editions do. 

image_urls are weird. 
In JavaScript it'd be like 
card.editions[0].image_urls["en"][0]


prices are kinda weird too
card.editions[0].price["high"]
card.editions[0].price["mid"]
card.editions[0].price["low"]
